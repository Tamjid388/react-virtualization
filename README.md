## ✅ Task Overview

**Objective:**  
Render a list of **100 dummy elements** using **virtualization** to ensure that only a fixed amount of data is rendered at a time, keeping the UI smooth and performant.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React (Vite + JSX)
- [react-virtuoso](https://virtuoso.dev/) (for list virtualization)
- CSS / Tailwind (optional)

## 🧠 Why Virtualization?

Rendering large lists without optimization can degrade performance and affect user experience.  
By using **react-virtuoso**, only the visible list items are rendered in the DOM. This ensures smooth scrolling and faster load times.
